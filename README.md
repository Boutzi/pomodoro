# Pomodoro

## Overview
Pomodoro is a simple timer application built using C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). It follows the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features
- **Pomodoro Timer**: Set a timer for your work session, typically 25 minutes long.
- **Short Break Timer**: Take short breaks after each work session, typically 5 minutes long.
- **Long Break Timer**: After completing a set number of work sessions, take a longer break, typically 15 minutes long.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust the duration of the pomodoro, short break, and long break sessions according to your preferences.
- **Cycle Counter**: Keep track of how many pomodoro cycles you've completed.
